# 🏨 Hotel Management System

A comprehensive Hotel Management System built with **Java** to demonstrate core **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts.

## 📋 About The Project

This project is a console-based hotel management application that allows users to manage rooms, customers, bookings, billing, and payments. It serves as a practical implementation of key OOP principles learned in Java programming.

## ✨ Features

- 🏠 **Room Management**: Add, view, search, and manage different room types
- 👤 **Customer Management**: Store and manage customer information
- 📅 **Booking System**: Create, view, cancel, and manage room bookings
- 💰 **Billing System**: Generate bills with room charges and additional services
- 💳 **Payment Processing**: Support for multiple payment methods (Cash, Card, Online)
- 🛎️ **Service Management**: Add room service, laundry, and other services to bookings
- 🔍 **Search & Filter**: Find rooms by availability, type, and price range

## 🎯 OOP Concepts Demonstrated

- ✅ **Encapsulation**: Private fields with getters/setters
- ✅ **Inheritance**: Room type hierarchy (Standard, Deluxe, Suite)
- ✅ **Polymorphism**: Method overriding for different room behaviors
- ✅ **Abstraction**: Abstract classes and interfaces for payments and services
- ✅ **Composition**: Hotel has Rooms, Bookings, and Customers
- ✅ **Exception Handling**: Custom exceptions for validation
- ✅ **Collections Framework**: ArrayList and HashMap usage

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language**: Java (JDK 8+)
- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition
- **Concepts**: OOP, Collections, Exception Handling
